- Seed phenotyping:
    + Seed size (projected area; also predict volume???)
    + Seed dimensions (length of major and minor axes)
    + Their distribution affect:
        - Dispersion?
        - Viability?
        - Longevity?
        - Dormancy?
    +Applied context - maybe extended to other crops where seed size is an important yield component?

- Seed germination is an easy/straightforward phenotype to measure - count number of germinated seeds and divide by the total number of seeds
- In large germination experiments manual counting is labour-intensive.
- Although little training is required to measure germination rate, labour costs can become too large and human-error is unavoidable.
- There is no shortage of attempts to automate seed germination measurements and seed phenotyping.
- The main aim is to improve throughput, precision and accuracy.
- Throughput improves by allowing the computer/machine to measure germination rates quickly and without break.
- Precision and accuracy improve by removing the human element, i.e. computer codes never get tired and repeat the programmed instructions precisely every time.
